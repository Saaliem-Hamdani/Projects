/* OBSERVATIONS:
1. Orders were placed between September, 2016 to October 2018.
2. There are 4119 different cities and 27 different states in Brazil from which the customers have placed their orders in the given time period.
3. In 2016, the numbers of orders placed increased from October to November but decreased in December.
4. In 2017, the numbers of orders placed increased from January to November but decreased in December.
5. In 2018, we saw a mixed trend, decrement from January to February, increment in March, decrement till June, increment till August, and decreased after on.
6. We saw a monthly seasonality in terms of number of orders placed. Maximum orders were placed in May, July and August. Least Orders were placed in September and October.
7. Brazilian customers ordered most in afternoon and least in Dawn.
8. Most number of customers belong to Sao Paulo whereas Roraima has the least number of customers.
9. Highest Percentage increase in cost of orders was observed in February 2017 of 110.78%.
10. Highest Percentage decrease in cost of orders was observed in June 2017 of 13.77%.
11. Highest total price was observed in Sao Paulo while the lowest was observed in Raoraima.
12. Lowest average price was observed in Sao Paulo while the highest was observed in Paraiba.
13. Highest total freight value was observed in Sao Paulo while the lowest was observed in Raoraima.
14. Highest average freight value was observed in Raoraima while the lowest was observed in Sao Paulo.
15. Fastest delivery was observed in Sao Paulo as compared to other states with an average delivery time of 8 days.
16. Slowest delivery was observed in Raoraima as compared to other states with an average delivery time of 29 days.
17. Lowest average difference in Estimated time and Actual time was observed in Alagoas of 8 days.
18. Highest average difference in Estimated time and Actual time was observed in Acre of 19 days.
19. Most number of payments were done from credit card.
20. Most number of payments were done in only 1 installment while the least were done in 22 and 23 installments.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. As Brazilian customers mostly buy in afternoon, we can apply different types of offers and discounts in afternoon to increase the orders. Stores should be open specially in afternoon. All the repairing work can be done in Dawn as there are least orders.
2. We should increase the customer aquisition in Raoraima by marketing, advertisements etc. as it has the least customers. It also has the slowest delivery which may be the the factor of low customers which should be improved.
3. Average difference between estimated time and actual time in acre should be reduced to improve revenue.
4. As most number of payments were done through credit card, offers and discounts on credit cards should be provided to increase the revenue.
